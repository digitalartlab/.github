## Welcome to the Lab ðŸ‘‹

We're the R&D department of CKC & partners, a cultural centre in Zoetermeer, The Netherlands. We experiment at the intersection of art and technology.

### Starting a new project?
We want to make jumping between projects as easy as possible, so we work with a set of standardized frameworks and technologies. Please check the [Get Started](https://github.com/digitalartlab/get-started) documentation to help you select the right ones.

### Welcome one, welcome all!
All great things start in a safe environment. Please take a moment to read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/digitalartlab/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), so we're all on the same page.
